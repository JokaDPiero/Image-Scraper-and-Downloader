# Image-Scraper-and-Downloader

This is a simple script which automates the images an user wants and downloads them in the directory specified by the user.
It is coded in [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) and I've used the firefox web driver to automate the results.
You can also try with google or safari browser just download the chrome or safari web driver and do necessary configurations(**Just GOOGLE it**).

## Getting Started
### Before running the script things you must do-
1.Clone the repo using -
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JokaDPiero/Image-Scraper-and-Downloader.git
```
2.If you have anaconda installed create a new environment using -
```bash
conda create --name yourenv python==3.8
```
3.After creation, activate the environment using -
```bash
conda activate yourenv
```
4.Then go to the cloned directory using **cd** and install the requirements using -
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5.Open the python script and make necessary changes -
**Add webdriver path** and
**Add download path**

6.Run the script.

**or**

7.In terminal type -
```bash
python image_scraper+downloader.py
```
 **If you don't have anaconda and use any other python IDE ,then follow step 4 to 7.**

### Thats it!! Enjoy.
